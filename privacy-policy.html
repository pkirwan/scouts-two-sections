				<h1>Who we are</h1>
				<p>This is the website of 21st Hammersmith Scout Group, a Scout group based in West London. Our website address is: https://www.21sthammersmith.org.uk.</p>
				<h1>What personal data we collect and why we collect it</h1>
				<h2>Contact form</h2>
				<p>If you fill in the form on our contact page your contact information is sent to the leaders so that they can email you the information you have asked for. We keep this information for a year so that we have a record of the level of interest in the group.</p>
				<p>We use Google Drive to collect and store this information. View the Google privacy policy at: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>.</p>
				<h2>Personal details form</h2>
				<p>If you choose to come to a trial session and fill in the personal details form, this information will be held securely using the Online Scout Manager system and made accessible to leaders. This is important for your child's safety in meetings and on trips, so that leaders can access emergency contact details and are aware of any medical conditions that might be important. If a leader no longer volunteers with the group, they no longer have access to this information.</p>
				<p>View the Online Scout Manager <a href="https://www.onlinescoutmanager.co.uk/cookies.html">privacy policy</a> and <a href="https://www.onlinescoutmanager.co.uk/security.html">data security policy</a>.</p>

				<h2>Embedded content from other websites</h2>
				<p>Pages on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.</p>

				<h1>Who we share your data with</h1>
				<p>We keep an up to date list of current members. Personal details are held securely using the Online Scout Manager system, with only leaders able to access them. Personal information is only used for the purpose it was collected i.e. to allow us to run the group effectively and provide a good service to members. We will only contact you if we need to discuss group matters or to inform you of group updates.</p>

				<h1>How long we retain your data</h1>
				<p>We only hold personal information for as long as is necessary, and this is limited to what the group needs. When a member leaves the group we will delete their personal information. This means that if you leave the group and then rejoin you might be asked to provide these details again.</p>
				<h1>What rights you have over your data</h1>
				<p>If you are a member or the parent/guardian of a member of the group, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you or your child, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you or your child. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.</p>
